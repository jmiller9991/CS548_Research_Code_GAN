# Generating Facial Recognition Data usingStyleGAN2

***Overview***

This is the code repository for the paper Generating Facial Recognition Data using StyleGAN2. This code was written as part of the CS 490/548 course taught by Dr. Michael J. Reale at SUNY Polytechnic in Fall 2020. This code was written by Justin Firsching ([JustinFirsching](https://github.com/JustinFirsching) and [justin-firsching](https://github.com/justin-firsching) on GitHub), Andrew Bertino ([AndrewBert](https://github.com/AndrewBert) and [TheCrackSpider](https://github.com/TheCrackSpider) on GitHub), Jacob Miller ([jmiller9991](https://github.com/jmiller9991) on GitHub), and Dr. Michael J. Reale ([PrimarchOfTheSpaceWolves
](https://github.com/PrimarchOfTheSpaceWolves) on GitHub). This is also based on the projects [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) by Karras et al. and [stylegan-encoder](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder) by Puzer.
